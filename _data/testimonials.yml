  testimonial: "It might sound cliché, but it really is true. Burning Man is not a festival. It is the ultimate rabbit hole. You start your day (or night) with the intention of going to that place, or doing that thing. It almost never happens – after that tea in some tent someone convinces you it's a good idea to go check out a maze where people are sitting at the center of it. And you keep going down that rabbit hole and you never arrive where you planned. I'd go as far as to say this – you should actually feel bad about \"reaching your goals\", because it means you missed out on opportunities to branch out, to discover new things out there, to meet new, amazing people."
